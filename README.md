## üìå Overview  
ESP32-based IoT projects concerning:  

1. **Maximum Sampling Frequency Identification :** demonstrates the ESP32's capability to achieve high-frequency sampling.

2. **Optimal Sampling Frequency Adaptation :** dynamically adjusts sampling rates using FFT analysis, adhering to Nyquist principles with a safety margin (e.g., sampling at 2.5√ó the detected maximum frequency).
For instance:
      * Detects peak frequency ùëì = 5Hz ‚Üí sets sampling rate to 12.5Hz (2.5√ó). 

3. **Computes local aggregates :** calculates aggregates of the sampled signal over a windows (e.g., data-driven sliding window).  
4. **Transmits data** via:  
   - **WiFi/MQTT :** transmits aggregate values to a nearby edge server in real-time using the lightweight MQTT protocol over WiFi, enabling low-latency monitoring and rapid response.  
   - **LoRaWAN + TTN + MQTT :** sends aggregate values to a edge server via LoRaWAN and The Things Network (TTN), leveraging TTN‚Äôs MQTT integration.

## Detailed Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Determine Maximum Sampling Frequency of Heltec ESP32 WIFI LoRa V3

In this phase, we determine the maximum sampling frequency at which our type of ESP32 can operate. This frequency is greatly influenced by how we acquire the signal that as to be sampled. For instance, if we capure the signal using a UART, the maximum sampling frequency will be limited by the baud rate of the UART connection, .In our case, the signal is generate locally in the firmware and internally sampled, this means that the maximum sampling frequency is limited by the minimum delay between two sample. Which it's bounded by the period of freeRTOS's ticks, defined by the OS as
```
portTICK_PERIOD_MS = 1 / configTICK_RATE_HZ = 1 / 1000 = 1 ms
```
So we the maximum theoretical frequency is 1000Hz, specially if we assume that: 

* The sampling task has the highest priority.
* The sampling code itself adds negligible runtime overhead.

In the code the maximum theoretical frequency is used to determine the optimal one. Sampling that higher frequencies will produce unresonable value of the samples.

### Phase 2: Compute Optimal sampling frequency

Choosing between higher or lower sampling frequencies involves critical engineering trade-offs:
**Trade offs**
- **Higher Sampling Rates** :
  
     - **Advantages**: Better signal reconstruction, reduced ISI.
       
     - **Drawbacks**: Increased CPU load, memory usage, and power consumption.
- **Lower Sampling Rates** :
  
     - **Advantages**: Resource-efficient.
       
     - **Drawbacks**: Risk of aliasing, ISI, and loss of high-frequency details.

To resolve these trade-offs, this phase focuses on computing the **optimal sampling frequency** that balances efficiency and signal integrity. The so called frequency is obtained levegering, the highest frequency of the signal and the Shannon-Nyquist theorem, to determine an efficient sampling rate capable of reconstructing the signal without aliasing or Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). Specifically, the sampling theorem states that it's possible to reconstruct a continue signal by performing a sampling with a frequency higher that 2 * $\f_max$, eventhough a common engineering practice is to pick $\f_sample$ = 2.5 * $\f_max$ for safety margins.

**Program steps**
1. **Sample at maximum frequency possible for the ESP32**
     Given the maximum possible sample rate we sample the signal for a total of 1024 samples. This has the goal to correctly careaterize the input signal.
2. **Compute FFT and apply window**
3. **Compute the major peak of the signal**
4. **Determine the optimal sampling frequency**

**Practical example**
- **Input**: `2*sin(2œÄ*3*t) + 4*sin(2œÄ*5*t)`
- **Initial sampling frequency**: 1KHz
- **Results:**

The experimental results are corrected, indeed the input signal is a sum of two sinusoid with frequency 3Hz and 5Hz. This can also be view simply by doing the Fourier traform of the function:
