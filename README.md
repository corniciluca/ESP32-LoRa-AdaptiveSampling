# ESP32-LoRa-AdaptiveSampling  
**ESP32-based IoT system leveraging FreeRTOS to implement intelligent sensor sampling. The solution dynamically optimizes sampling rates using Nyquist-compliant FFT analysis, combined with efficient edge/cloud communication through hybrid LoRaWAN, MQTT and WIFI protocols.**

## üìå Overview  
ESP32-based IoT projects concerning:  

1. **Maximum Sampling Frequency Identification :** demonstrates the ESP32's capability to achieve high-frequency sampling.

2. **Optimal Sampling Frequency Adaptation :** dynamically adjusts sampling rates using FFT analysis, adhering to Nyquist principles with a safety margin (e.g., sampling at 2.5√ó the detected maximum frequency).
For instance:
      * Detects peak frequency ùëì = 5Hz ‚Üí sets sampling rate to 12.5Hz (2.5√ó). 

3. **Computes local aggregates :** calculates aggregates of the sampled signal over a windows (e.g., data-driven sliding window).  
4. **Transmits data** via:  
   - **WiFi/MQTT :** transmits aggregate values to a nearby edge server in real-time using the lightweight MQTT protocol over WiFi, enabling low-latency monitoring and rapid response.  
   - **LoRaWAN + TTN + MQTT :** sends aggregate values to a edge server via LoRaWAN and The Things Network (TTN), leveraging TTN‚Äôs MQTT integration.
