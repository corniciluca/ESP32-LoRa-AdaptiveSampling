# ESP32-LoRa-AdaptiveSampling  
**ESP32-based IoT system leveraging FreeRTOS to implement intelligent sensor sampling. The solution dynamically optimizes sampling rates using Nyquist-compliant FFT analysis, combined with efficient edge/cloud communication through hybrid LoRaWAN, MQTT and WIFI protocols.**

## üìå Overview  
ESP32-based IoT projects concerning:  

1. **Maximum Sampling Frequency Identification :** demonstrates the ESP32's capability to achieve high-frequency sampling.

2. **Optimal Sampling Frequency Adaptation :** dynamically adjusts sampling rates using FFT analysis, adhering to Nyquist principles with a safety margin (e.g., sampling at 2.5√ó the detected maximum frequency).
For instance:
      * Detects peak frequency ùëì = 5Hz ‚Üí sets sampling rate to 12.5Hz (2.5√ó). 

3. **Computes local aggregates :** calculates aggregates of the sampled signal over a windows (e.g., data-driven sliding window).  
4. **Transmits data** via:  
   - **WiFi/MQTT :** transmits aggregate values to a nearby edge server in real-time using the lightweight MQTT protocol over WiFi, enabling low-latency monitoring and rapid response.  
   - **LoRaWAN + TTN + MQTT :** sends aggregate values to a edge server via LoRaWAN and The Things Network (TTN), leveraging TTN‚Äôs MQTT integration.

## Detailed Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Determine Maximum Sampling Frequency of Heltec ESP32 WIFI LoRa V3

In this phase we determine the maximum sampling frequency at which our type of ESP32 can operate. This frequency is greatly influenced by how we acquire the signal that as to be sampled. For instance, if we capure the signal using a UART, the maximum sampling frequency will be limited by the baud rate of the UART connection, .In our case, the signal is generate locally in the firmware and internally sampled, this means that the maximum sampling frequency is limited by the minimum delay between two sample. Which it's bounded by the period of freeRTOS's ticks, defined by the OS as
```
portTICK_PERIOD_MS = 1 / configTICK_RATE_HZ = 1 / 1000 = 1 ms
```



 

### Phase 2: Compute Optimal sampling frequency

### Phase 3: Compute aggregates values

### Phase 4: Transmit averages to Edge Server via TTN/MQTT/WIFI

#### Phase 4.1: Transmit averages to Edge Server via TTN/MQTT/WIFI

#### Phase 4.2: Transmit averages to Edge Server via TTN/MQTT/WIFI

### Energy consumption

### End-to-end latency

### Data volume
